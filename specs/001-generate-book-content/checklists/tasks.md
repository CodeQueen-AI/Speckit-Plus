# Task Quality Checklist: Generate Book Content

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Task Completeness

- [x] All functional requirements from the spec are covered by tasks.
- [x] Each task has clear, measurable acceptance criteria.
- [x] Tasks are granular enough for individual implementation.
- [x] Dependencies between tasks are clearly identified.
- [x] All risks identified in the plan have corresponding mitigation tasks (if applicable).
- [x] Edge cases from the spec are addressed by tasks.

## Task Quality

- [x] Tasks avoid implementation details where possible (focus on *what* not *how*).
- [x] Tasks are unambiguous.
- [x] Tasks are ordered logically.
- [x] Test tasks are comprehensive and cover all scenarios.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require task updates before implementation.
