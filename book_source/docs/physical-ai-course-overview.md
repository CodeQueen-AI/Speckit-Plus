# Physical AI: Bridging the Digital Brain and the Physical Body

The future of Artificial Intelligence extends far beyond digital spaces, moving robustly into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces **Physical AI**—a revolutionary approach to AI systems that function within reality, comprehending and interacting with physical laws. Students embarking on this journey will learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions, primarily utilizing ROS 2.

## Why Physical AI?

Humanoid robots are uniquely positioned to excel in our human-centered world. Their shared physical form allows them to be trained with abundant data from interacting in diverse human environments, facilitating a seamless integration into daily life and work. This represents a significant transition from traditional AI models confined solely to digital or abstract problem spaces. By developing AI that perceives, reasons, and acts in the physical world, we unlock unprecedented possibilities for assistance, exploration, and collaboration.

## Course Demands and Focus

This course is technically demanding, sitting at the intersection of three heavy computational loads:

1.  **Robotics Software & Control**: Involves real-time operating systems, sensor fusion, inverse kinematics, and complex control loops essential for physical manipulation and navigation.
2.  **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: Encompasses deep learning for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and advanced AI techniques for decision-making.
3.  **High-Fidelity Simulation**: Requires powerful physics engines to accurately model real-world interactions, gravity, friction, and collision dynamics, crucial for safe and efficient robot development and testing.

Students will gain hands-on experience with:

-   **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: The industry-standard middleware for building complex robot applications.
-   **Simulation Environments**: Learning to use tools that accurately simulate physical environments to test and refine robot behaviors.
-   **Hardware Integration**: Understanding how AI models translate into physical actions and perceive the world through sensors like the Intel RealSense cameras.
-   **Advanced AI Techniques**: Exploring topics such as cognitive planning using Large Language Models and voice-to-action systems.

This capstone is designed to challenge and equip students with the skills necessary to innovate at the forefront of Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
